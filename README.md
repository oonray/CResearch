CResearch
=========

Please see Individual readme's for more info.

# Learning
Contains my journy inlearning C.
I will add new tutorials that i go trough there.

# Projects
This contains PRojects that i undertake.

These currently contain:
    * Writing a rootkit
    * Writing a NTP Server
    * Writing a VM
    * Arduino based project

Most of this code is connected to some practical or educational use. 

# Research
The difference between reasearch and PRoject is that research is code written ment to hilight a consept.
This code is not ment to work or be used in any project but is purly code for codes sake, and is more of a cookbook or junkyard of dangling and unfinished code.

Contains:
    * Spectre & Meltdown
